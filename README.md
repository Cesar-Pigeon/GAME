# GAME
This is my advanced programming project, it's basically a 2d platform game in which enemies come after you and you have to dodge them, it has 5 scenes, the menu, the character selection, the game scene of each character, and the game over screen.
You have the option to choose between 2 characters, depending on which one you choose will be the setting and the enemies that appear.
Background music was also added to make it more entertaining when playing.
It has a score that increases the longer you survive.
The game does not have an ending, you have to survive as long as possible.
